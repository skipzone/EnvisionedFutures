Required Library Modifications
------------------------------

The Teensy Audio library must be modified for compatibility with the version
of SdFat that EFAudioController uses.  The modifyTeensyLibrary.sh script in
PJRC_Audio copies the necessary files while preserving the originals.  You
will likely need to modify the path to the Audio library directory in the
script.

SdFat/SdFatConfig.h enables options required by EFAudioController.  Replace
the copy that comes with SdFat version 1.0.6, or use the provided file as a
guide (diff is your friend here) to see which options need to be enabled.
