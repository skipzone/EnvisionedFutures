Audio recording and playback system for the Envisioned Futures art project

Envisioned Futures is an interactive art project created by the multitalented artist Katya Ivanova as part of her larger Emerging Futures project.  Envisioned Futures consists of four dioramas of future cityscapes, each lit with LEDs and sitting inside a mirrored infinity cube.  In addition to presenting a vision of the future, the diorama provides the opportunity for viewers to communicate with the future by recording and listening to audio messages.
